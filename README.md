#DESCRIPTION
Time Tracker & Productivity Analytics is a lightweight Chrome extension designed to help users monitor and analyze how they spend their time online. The extension automatically tracks the amount of time spent on each website, categorizing domains as productive (e.g., coding platforms) or unproductive (e.g., social media), and stores this data locally or via a backend API. It features a real-time dashboard where users can view detailed usage statistics, daily and weekly productivity summaries, and visual insights through charts and graphs. Built using JavaScript, HTML/CSS, and Chrome Extension APIs, with an optional backend powered by Node.js and MongoDB, this tool is ideal for individuals looking to improve focus, reduce distractions, and optimize their digital habits.
